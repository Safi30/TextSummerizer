# TextSummerizer

Automated Text Summarization Project Report

Objective: Develop an automated text summarization model that can extract key points from large volumes of text data.

Technique Used:
The code provided uses the Hugging Face library and the Transformers package to implement text summarization. It leverages the pipeline function from the Transformers library, specifically the "summarization" pipeline, to generate the summary of the input text.

Approach:

Import the necessary libraries, including the pipeline function from the Transformers package.
Define the summarize function that takes in the input text and other parameters such as max_length, min_length, and do_sample.
Within the summarize function, create the summarization pipeline using pipeline("summarization").
Use the summarization pipeline to generate the summary of the input text by passing the text and the specified parameters.
Return the generated summary by accessing the "summary_text" key from the output.
Outside the function, provide the input text to be summarized.
Call the summarize function with the input text.
Print the generated summary.
Challenges Faced:
The main challenge in implementing this project was ensuring the correct setup of the Hugging Face library and the Transformers package. It required installing the necessary dependencies and ensuring compatibility with the Python environment. Additionally, choosing appropriate values for the max_length and min_length parameters can affect the quality and length of the generated summary.
